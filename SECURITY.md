## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there are any vulnerabilities, don't hesitate to _report them_.

1. Email one of the [Main Developers](https://github.com/project-undefined/Vansch-OS#developers).
2. Describe the vulnerability.

   If you have a fix, that is most welcome -- please attach or summarize it in your message!

3. We will evaluate the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix or mitigating steps to address it. We will contact you to let you know the outcome, and will credit you in the report.

   Please **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until a fix is released, or a [Main Developer](https://github.com/project-undefined/Vansch-OS#developers) gives you explicit permission!

4. Once we have either a) published a fix, or b) declined to address the vulnerability for whatever reason, you are free to publicly disclose it.
